Blowpipe Overhaul makes using blowpipes a viable ranger subclass throughout the entire game!

+ 25 new Blowpipes
+ 3 new seed types
+ 1 new accessory
+ 1 new Shroomite Helmet

Blowpipe Overhaul also makes the original Blowpipe craftable and makes the Dryad sell seeds. 

If you have any suggestions/issues please let me know in the comments or contact me on discord (nate7688)

Right now some dust and sounds from weapons may not show for everyone in multiplayer; however, everything is still perfectly functional.
I might try to improve the netcode in the future to fix this.

The sprites are not the best as I'm not a very good pixel artist...
If you want to redo any of the sprites, please send them to me over discord, I would be happy to include them and credit you :)

Thanks to Luckyboy726 for helping test the mod and shooting down all of my good ideas!
Thanks to Mr. Highway for helping for making some sounds!
